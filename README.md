# 98-119 iPhone Development, Spring 2009

This is the website for a course I taught on iPhone development at Carnegie Mellon University. Hosted here: https://oyamauchi.github.io/98-119/

CMU has a program called "StuCo", in which students can design and teach a semester-long course. Students who take the course get credit, roughly 1/3 the amount of a normal course. The teacher also gets the same amount of credit. (At least, that was the case in 2009; it may have changed since then.)

Previous to this, I had taught a StuCo on Mac OS X development three times. This was the first time I switched to iPhone, but the experience with the Mac OS version had helped me a lot in ironing out what to teach and how.

StuCo doesn't let you set formal prerequisites, but I told students coming in that I would assume programming proficiency equivalent to the 200-level programming course that all CS majors take.

The course met once a week for 80 minutes. I had the students download the starter code, and I worked on it live (with my screen projected) and had them follow along on their laptops. Then the homework for the next week would be to extend that same code a little further. (I intended the homeworks to take less than 10 minutes each.)

I've left all the code as it was in 2009. Given how much the iOS SDK has changed since then, I doubt it would run out-of-the-box anymore.

You'll see references to "LabFusion"; that's a web app I created that allowed students to submit assignments and receive feedback.
