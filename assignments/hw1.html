This homework is a simple extension of the application from the first class.

    <td>
      <p>In the first class, we saw how to make a button that increments a counter variable
      and displays its current value in a text field. This homework ensures that you&#8217;re
      familiar with outlets and actions &#8212; how to declare, set and use them. It also
      forces you to look up something you haven&#8217;t seen before in the SDK documentation.</p>
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td class="heading">Task</td>
    <td>
      <p>Make an app with a progress bar and a button. The progress bar
      should start at 0%. Each time the user presses the button, 10% of the progress bar
      should fill up, so that after 10 presses, the progress bar is full. After that, button
      presses should have no effect.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="heading">Hints</td>
    <td>
      <p>The first place you should look is the documentation for <code>UIProgressView</code>.
      The steps you have to do are largely the same as shown in the first class, except you
      need to learn how to use <code>UIProgressView</code>.</p>
      <p>It&#8217;s OK to just modify the finished code from the first class, but it would
      be better practice for you to make the project from scratch.</p>
