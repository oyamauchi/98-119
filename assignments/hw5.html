    <p>Create another preference specifier for LanguageList, a &#8220;Multi Value&#8221; element.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The element should allow the user to choose from a list of language families<sup>1</sup>.</li>
      <li>The title should reflect that.</li>
      <li>The possible values of the preference can be whatever you want, but one of them
        should be &#8220;Germanic&#8221;, and that should be the default value.</li>
      <li>You should reflect the preference in the application by the <code>ListController</code>&#8217;s
        title. You don&#8217;t have to change the list of languages based on the preference,
        unless you&#8217;re ambitious and into this sort of thing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="explan"><sup>1</sup> Technically, the Germanic languages are not a language
      family in and of themselves. A language family is a &#8220;maximal set&#8221; of related
      languages; that is, there are no languages outside the family that are demonstrably
      related to any languages in the family. This is not true of Germanic languages. They
      are a subfamily of the Indo-European language family, which contains a wide variety
      of other subfamilies: any spoken in Europe except Basque, Hungarian and Finnish, as
      well as the vast multitude of Indic languages descended from Sanskrit.</p>

    <p>Settings bundles aren&#8217;t a Cocoa class, so the documentation for them is not where
      most of the docs you&#8217;ve used so far are. The
      <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/PreferenceSettings/Conceptual/SettingsApplicationSchemaReference/Introduction/Introduction.html">Settings Application Schema Reference</a>
      should be very useful. You can also look at the Application Preferences chapter of
      the iPhone Application Programming Guide.</p>
    <p>Looking at the docs for <code>NSUserDefaults</code> could be helpful too.</p>
