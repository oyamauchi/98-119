    <p>Modify the custom cell in SpeakersList to have an on/off switch control instead
      of the text field on the right (I'll leave it up to you to find out what class
      implements that control). The switch should be set to "on" for rows where the
      name of the language has an odd number of characters, and "off" for the rest.</p>
    <p>The right edge of the switch control should be 20 pixels away from the right edge
      of the screen, and it should be vertically centered in the cell.</p>

    <p>Documentation.</p>
    <p>This assignment is mainly dealing with geometry. Note that there are two methods
      you will be interested in: <code>frame</code> and <code>bounds</code>. A view's
      frame is its dimensions as seen by its superview. A view's bounds is its dimensions
      as seen from inside itself. Most of the time (including in this assignment), the
      origin component of bounds is (0, 0), whereas the origin component of frame for the
      same view is not zero (it's wherever the view is positioned inside its superview).
      So you will be interested in the cell's bounds and the switch's frame.</p>
