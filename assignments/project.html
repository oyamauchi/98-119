The final project will be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_search">word
search game</a>. This is a common pencil-and-paper game, with
a square grid of letters, in which several words are embedded. You&#8217;re given a list of
the words, and you have to find and circle each of them in the grid. Words can run horizontally,
vertically and diagonally, in either direction.
This kind of interaction lends itself well to the touch screen: when you find a word, you
can just drag your finger over it.

    <p>
      Generating new word search puzzles is nontrivial, and that&#8217;s not the point of this project,
      so I&#8217;ve implemented the logic for you. Download the code above
      and drop it into your Xcode project. Look at the sample project and the comments in
      <code>PuzzleGenerator.h</code> to see how to use it. Also, make sure to read the
      comments at the top of <code>PuzzleGenerator.m</code> for important information
      about the algorithm and its limitations.
    </p>
    <p>
    You&#8217;re free to modify the puzzle generation code as much as you like. However, make sure
    to say you did so in your documentation (see the &#8220;Submission and grading&#8221; section) so I
    know to look at your changes.

    <p>There are only three acceptable kinds of code in a project submission: code you
    wrote yourself, code I wrote, and code that you adapted from Apple documentation or
    sample code.</p>
    <p>In particular, of course, this means you are not allowed to share code among
    yourselves. You can certainly share advice, but not code.</p>
    <p>You&#8217;re free to read any sources you want (Cocoa help sites, etc.) but I don&#8217;t
    want you copying code from them. If you&#8217;re not sure if something constitutes copying,
    ask me.</p>

    Submission is through LabFusion.

    <p><span class="omgred">Note</span>: include a readme documenting your general
      approach, any major UI design decisions you made, any extra features you made, etc.</p>

      <p>
      Grading is out of 15 total points.
      <ul>
      <li>6 points for the UI: well-designed,
      well-thought out and attractive UIs get more points.</li>
      <li>6 points for code quality:
      consistent and reasonable coding style, correct memory management, good use of APIs
      (for example, you&#8217;d lose credit for reimplementing functionality that&#8217;s already in
      Cocoa), and good separation of functionality into classes and MVC layers.</li>
      <li>3 points for polish: any additional features you added, how appropriate and
      well-executed they are.</li>
